I am a Ph.D Student in [Biomedical Informatics](https://med.stanford.edu/bmi.html) at Stanford University, advised by [Jonathan Pritchard](https://web.stanford.edu/group/pritchardlab/home.html). I am also a [Microsoft Research PhD Fellow](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/phd-fellowship/people/): my current work is in developing network-based models for gene expression and other complex traits. My interests are broadly in the statistical genetics and systems biology of complex disease.
