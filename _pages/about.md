I am a Ph.D Student in [Biomedical Informatics](https://med.stanford.edu/bmi.html) at Stanford University, advised by [Jonathan Pritchard](https://web.stanford.edu/group/pritchardlab/home.html). My current work is in developing network-based models for gene expression and other complex traits; I am broadly interested in problems related to statistical genetics.
