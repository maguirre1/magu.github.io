I am a Ph.D Student in [Biomedical Informatics](https://med.stanford.edu/bmi.html) at Stanford University, advised by [Jonathan Pritchard](https://web.stanford.edu/group/pritchardlab/home.html). My research interests are broadly in the statistical genetics and systems biology of human traits and diseases. I am currently funded by a [Microsoft Research PhD Fellowship](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/phd-fellowship/people/), and my thesis work is on developing network-based models for gene expression and other complex traits. Outside the lab, I enjoy hiking around the Bay Area and solving puzzles (especially crosswords!).
