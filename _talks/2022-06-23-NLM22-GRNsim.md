Preliminary description of methods to simulate gene regulatory networks (GRNs) with realistic structure, function, and expression data, with early results to connect the statistical genetic basis of complex traits in context of GRNs. Presented as a poster at the "National Library of Medicine Training Informatics Conference" ([NLM-ITC](https://ubwp.buffalo.edu/nlm2022/)) hosted by the University of Buffalo -- more information about the training conference can be found [here](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/ep/GrantTrainInstitute.html).

Advisor: Jonathan Pritchard.
