Results on a modeling study to interrelate the structure and function of gene regulatory networks. Characterized the impact of network summary statistics on the distribution of effects from genetic and experimental perturbations, and discussed implications for inference tasks on observational and interventional data sources. 

Presented as a talk at the Probabilistic Modeling in Genomics (ProbGen) conference. More information [here](https://www.oeaw.ac.at/gmi/news-events/events/probabilistic-modeling-in-genomics-2024).
