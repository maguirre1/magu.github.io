Preliminary results towards developing a deep convolutional neural network to predict local ancestry tracts in whole-genome sequence data. Selected as a *reviewer's choice* abstract (scored by reviewers in top 10% of all poster abstracts), and presented as a Poster Talk. Now posted as an [arXiv preprint](../publication/2020-11-04-A-deep-learning-classifier-for-local-ancestry-inference). 

Presented as a virtual poster at the annual meeting of the American Society of Human Genetics (ASHG). More information [here](https://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/9070/presentation/3815).

Advisor: Alexander Ioannidis.
