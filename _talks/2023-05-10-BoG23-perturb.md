Preliminary results on a simulation study to interrelate the structure and function of gene regulatory networks. Characterized the impact of network summary statistics on the distribution of effects from genetic and experimental perturbations. 

Presented as a poster at the Biology of Genomes conference (BoG). More information [here](https://meetings.cshl.edu/abstracts.aspx?meet=GENOME&year=23).
