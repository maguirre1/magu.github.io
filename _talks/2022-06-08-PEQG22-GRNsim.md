Preliminary description of methods to simulate gene regulatory networks (GRNs) with realistic structure, function, and expression data, with early results to connect the statistical genetic basis of complex traits in context of GRNs. Presented as a poster at the "Population, Evolutionary, and Quantitative Genetics Conference" ([PEQG 2022](https://genetics-gsa.org/peqg-2022/)), hosted by the Genetics Society of America ([GSA](https://genetics-gsa.org/)).

Advisor: Jonathan Pritchard.
