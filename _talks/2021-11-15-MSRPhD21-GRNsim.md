Preliminary description of methods to simulate gene regulatory networks (GRNs) with realistic structure, function, and expression data, with early results with implications for GRN structure inference tasks and the statistical basis of complex trait heritability. Given as a talk to Microsoft Research via the "Microsoft Research PhD Fellowship Research Showcase", which highlights research conducted by the [Microsoft Research PhD Fellows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/phd-fellowship/people/). 

Advisor: Jonathan Pritchard.
