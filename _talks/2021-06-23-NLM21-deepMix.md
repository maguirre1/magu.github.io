Preliminary results towards developing a deep convolutional neural network to predict local ancestry tracts in whole-genome sequence data. Presented as a poster at the "National Library of Medicine Training Informatics Conference" ([NLM-ITC](https://web.cvent.com/event/1543af76-97cc-4042-b704-d401b3b1b8ac)) hosted by the University of Washington -- more information about the training conference can be found [here](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/ep/GrantTrainInstitute.html). This project has been posted as an [arXiv preprint](../publication/2020-11-04-A-deep-learning-classifier-for-local-ancestry-inference).

Advisor: Alexander Ioannidis.
