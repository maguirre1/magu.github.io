Preliminary results on a simulation study to interrelate the structure and function of gene regulatory networks. Characterized the impact of network summary statistics on the distribution of effects from genetic and experimental perturbations. 

Presented as a poster at the annual meeting of the American Society of Human Genetics (ASHG). More information [here](https://www.ashg.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ASHG2022-PosterAbstracts.pdf#%5B%7B%22num%22%3A4052%2C%22gen%22%3A0%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22XYZ%22%7D%2C70%2C707%2C0%5D).
