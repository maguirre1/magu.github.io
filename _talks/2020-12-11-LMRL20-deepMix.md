Preliminary results towards developing a deep convolutional neural network to predict local ancestry tracts in whole-genome sequence data. Presented as a poster at the "Learning Meaningful Representations of Life" ([LMRL](https://www.lmrl.org/)) workshop. Now posted as an [arXiv preprint](../publication/2020-11-04-A-deep-learning-classifier-for-local-ancestry-inference).

Advisor: Alexander Ioannidis.
