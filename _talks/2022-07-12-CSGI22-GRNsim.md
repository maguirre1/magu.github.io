I attended the first short program of the Computational Genomics Summer Institute ([CGSI](http://computationalgenomics.bioinformatics.ucla.edu/)) and gave a chalk talk describing a technique to simulate gene regulatory networks (GRNs) with realistic structure, function, and expression data.

Advisor: Jonathan Pritchard.
