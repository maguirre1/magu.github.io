I was an undergraduate course assistant for Math 1a: Introduction to Calculus, with several members of the math department at Harvard. I held course office hours, graded homework, and led workshops in pre-calculus. I was on course staff from Fall 2014 to Spring 2017. 

A description of the course is below.

Course Information
======
The development of calculus by Newton and Leibniz ranks among the greatest achievements of the past millennium. This course will help you see why by introducing: how differential calculus treats rates of change; how integral calculus treats accumulation; and how the fundamental theorem of calculus links the two. These ideas will be applied to problems from many other disciplines.
