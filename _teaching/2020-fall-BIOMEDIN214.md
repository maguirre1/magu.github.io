I was a course grader for BIOMEDIN 214: Representations and Algorithms for Computational Molecular Biology, with Professor Russ Altman. I held graded coursework and coordinated course logistics and feedback with the teaching staff. This course is part of the core curriculum in [Biomedical Informatics](https://med.stanford.edu/bmi.html) at Stanford. I was on course staff in Fall 2020 and Fall 2021. 

A description of the course is below. NB: the course was cross-listed in the departments of Bioengineering (BIOE214), Computer Science (CS274), and Genetics (GENE214).

Course Information
======
This course will introduce the basic computational methods used in molecular biology, combining core lectures, programming assignments, with midterm and final. The course will introduce and use biological data sources available on the internet. Topics will include basic algorithms for analysis of sequence, structure and function, particularly including alignment of biological sequences and structures, as well as more advanced representational and algorithmic issues. These include, for example, dynamic programming algorithms for alignment, structural superposition algorithms, computing with distance information, 1D and 3D motif definition and computation, hidden Markov models, phylogenetic trees, statistical feature detection, RNA sequence and structure, chemoinformatics and network analysis.
