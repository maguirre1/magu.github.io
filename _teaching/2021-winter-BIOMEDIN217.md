I was a graduate teaching assistant for BIOMEDIN 217: Translational Bioinformatics with Professor Dennis Wall. I held office hours, graded coursework, and facilitated course discussion. This course was part of the core curriculum in [Biomedical Informatics](https://med.stanford.edu/bmi.html) at Stanford. I was on course staff in Winter 2021 and Winter 2022. 

A description of the course is below. NB: the course was cross-listed in the departments of Bioengineering (BIOE217), Computer Science (CS275), and Genetics (GENE217).
