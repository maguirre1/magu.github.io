I was a graduate teaching assistant for BIOMEDIN 217: Translational Bioinformatics with Professor Dennis Wall. I held office hours, graded coursework, and facilitated course discussion. This course is part of the core curriculum in [Biomedical Informatics](https://med.stanford.edu/bmi.html) at Stanford. I am returning to course staff in Winter 2022. 

A description of the course is below.
